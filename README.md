# Angular Animations

This is a project I used to learn to make Angular Animations which I applied to my Portfolio Website

## AngularAnimation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
